# Poker Documentation

This is the documentation page for the Open Poker project. 
Source code for the project is available [here](https://github.com/Agentew04/poker).

The **Docs** page contains manuals, explanations and design documents for some aspects
of the game, including server and client applications.

The **API** page contains information about the source code, such as which classes exist and
what properties are available. It is updated automatically from the source code.
